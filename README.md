# Usecase behind this repository

A few People out of my bubble need a simple but feature rich e-commerce system which is compatible with the future of PHP and Web Development.
The original project this repository is forked from did this Step into the future already with a new Version, but they increased the amount of effort and the scope of knowledge needed to work with it immense.
While this worked out for most People, some prefered the simpler version it was before, but still would like to make use of more modern tools like composer, remove unneeded features from the core and improve some parts.

## Primary Task: Move this E-Commerce Framework into the Future

* Have proper support for Composer and autoloading
* provide a SymfonyConsole based cli entrypoint
* an build-in eventQueue
* have a simplified base theme without depending on JS frameworks

## Not Magento - but a independent fork of it

This is a Fork of Magento 1, or to be more exact of the comunity driven [LTS Repository](https://github.com/OpenMage/magento-lts/) of it.  
Classnames will not be changed, but most references to this Brand will be avoided and we may ask you to reference this Project not as a Magento Fork, but call it by its own name.  
We do not want to take advantage of their Brand, and only mention this here to clarify the connection and the origin of the source. (Licensing and Law stuff is hard, we are happy for any competent help here)
